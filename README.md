# 594_Group_Project Report 

1. Additional Feature. 

When user inputs "6", they will be firstly asked to type 'partial' or 'full" for partial/full vaccinations data, then they will be asked enter 'highest' or 'lowest' to search for town with the highest/lowest vaccination rate. The program will check for user input until they enter as required (case is insensitiv).

The the printVaccAreaInfo function will take the two user inputs and search for the zipcode that has the highest/lowest partial/full vaccination rate. They print out the town's population and property information (average property market value and average livable area).

The correctness is guaranteed as we compared with the three input files to make sure the outputs are consistent with the raw records.
